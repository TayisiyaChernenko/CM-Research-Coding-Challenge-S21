# ACM Research Coding Challenge (Spring 2021)

## Explanation
This project created a circular genome map of the Tomato Curly Stunt Virus from the provided genbank file. In order to accomplish this, the tools of the Biopython libraries were used to first parse the file with the SeqIO.read() method.Then, the feature set was created, setting colors for the genes. Once the diagram's features were all set, a track and diagram was created and drawn.
##Tools
To create this project, I utilized Biopython . This was installed with pip, using the command pip install Biopython.
In order to create the PDF with the actual graphic, I also installed ReportLab, using thr command pip install report lab.
Finally, the tutorial provided by Biopython was utilized for instructions on how to use the tools provides, as well as sample code(modified to parse my file and aesthetic preferences) from pages 280-281 and 288.
